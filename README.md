# Auth0 Lock

A Dart Wrapper for [Auth0 Lock](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock)

This package uses `dart:js` to wrap the functionality provided by `auth0-lock.js` in Dart classes.

The `auth0-lock.js` must be included for the wrapper to work:

```html

<!-- Latest minor release -->

<!-- Latest patch release (recommended for production) -->

```
